# Lua To EXE
Export/Compile .lua files into .exe files.
Tested with [Lua For Windows (Stable release)](https://github.com/rjpcomputing/luaforwindows/releases)

You don't need lua to compile, but you do need lua to run the compiled files.  
**Note: Do not run the program as administrator, or it won't work.**
